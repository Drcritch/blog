          <h4>OP.GG</h4>
            <img src="img/opgg.png" alt="OP GG" width ="200" height="200">
            The perfect tool for league players interested in current trends, stats, and info on regions, summoners and champions. Area for highest win % runes and items by champ. <em> You can look at current opponents history stats and as the jungler focus the people who have been successful recently or if your feeling particularly vengeful towards the ELO gods go after those on a losing streak and hope they crumble.</em>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.OP.GG" title="OPgg" class="button-cta" target="_blank" rel="\&quot;nofollow\&quot;"> Become OP! </a>

          <h4>Reddit</h4>
          <img src="img/reddit_logo.png" alt="Reddit Logo"  width ="200" height="200"> If you have heard of Reddit it probably means you weren't born yesterday. For those that haven't heard of Reddit I say welcome to our world little one.  Reddit, in my opinion, is the ultimate social media tool. There is something for everyone. Even us paradoxical Savage Dweebs can harvest a ton of benefit from this tool or alternatively pour your entire existence into the damn thing and become much worse off; with more 'karma' though. (probably)
          <p>

          <h4>Last Pass</h4>
          <img src="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fundrise_toolbox.png" alt="Fundrise">  Last Pass as in the Last Password you will ever have to remember. Another free tool to ultimately increase your cyber security and password management capabilities. An app and a chrome extension let you use Last Pass on all devices. You have one complicated master password to get into Last Pass and Last pass handles the rest. It can create extremely complicated autogenerated passwords and will autofill them through the app or web extension at the drop of hat. Never forget a password again and don't compromise with security.

            <a href="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/fundrise/" title="Fundrise" class="button-cta" target="_blank" rel="\&quot;nofollow\&quot;"> Just don't keep your master password taped to the monitor!

          <h4>Todoist</h4>
          <img src="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/roofstock_logo.png" alt="Roofstock"> Free tool, that helps you stay organized. If you're like me it's not easy to balance a video game addiction and gym addiction along with all of the other great things this world has to offer, but it can be done. ToDoist is a great app that simplifies and improves upon the regular to do list. You can create something to do add a due date description and this app will not let you forget about it, from notifications to automated emails you'll automatically receive plenty of reminders. Staying organized helps you get more things done and you'll never completely forget those small tasks that often slip the mind, giving you more time to do the things you want to do.
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/roofstock/" title="Roofstock" class="button-cta" target="_blank" rel="\&quot;nofollow\&quot;">  Get ToDoist and add all of these other tools to your first list as things to check out later.

          <h4>Audible</h4>
          <img src="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/vanguard-resources1.png" alt="Vanguard"> Audible, is Amazon's audio-book service. Subscription based option and fantastic. This tool goes beyond the Savage Dweeb. Books can help us improve in almost everything. The problem is it isn't always feasible for us to sit down set aside huge blocks of time and try to take these letters on page and have them stick as knowledge inside of our heads. We are busy people with way more important things to do like video games. However, with Audible you can soak up that knowledge not only in a much more natural way, but while simultaneously knocking out other menial tasks that most of us are fortunate enough to be burdened with. Have to get in some cardio? Go to the store? Fold your clothes? Long commute to and from work? might as well optimize that time and learn something. Whether that be some heavy science and you're wanting to up your dweeb level, or perhaps you want to know the latest studies on nutrition to evolve the savage side, or perhaps you just want to get better at letting go and jump into a novel there is something for <em>everyone</em> to gain from this tool.
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/vanguard/" title="Vanguard" class="button-cta" target="_blank" rel="\&quot;nofollow\&quot;"> First book is free. I recommend <u>12 rules for Life</u> by Jordan Peterson.
