      <h2>Civilization VI newest addition</h2>
      <time datetime="04-05-2019">APR. 5, 2019</time>
      <p>
        <em>Sid Meier</em> and team, continue to improve upon the world's first time machine. It's not quite the product that sci-fi writers have been dreaming up for decades, but it is a damn good first step. It remains one of the first times in human history where you can take a modern PC and convert its power to for time travel. Upon starting up the software you can jump back in time as far back as the ancient era to rediscover the wonders of our ancestors while simultaneously traveling hours or, more dangerously, days into the future of our modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian</a>a> timeline.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The new addition Gathering Storm throws in more natural frustrations and boosts the killing of our indefinite continued progress of existence via an intense addictive mechanism colloquially named "one more turn..".
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the new leaders and Civs: Canada, Maori, Inca, etc. provide even more dynamic game play. Some things that can be added to the growing list of pleasing events in the Civ are tunneling through an expansive mountain range and releasing an army onto the land of the naturally "protected" enemy city or building your first hockey rink as Wilfrid Laurier and smiling about how much fun those crazy Canucks must be having down there. Of course these great feelings are only heightened by the new lows incorporated into the game like choosing the Maori and taking 12 turns to find your first piece of land to later find it was probably 2 the other direction to a Great Barrier Reef starting position or, I don't know, a tornado that perfectly zig-zags it's way to the destruction of your only three cities. Most of the added disasters can be anticipated. The game provides some very good indicators and most can be used to develop preventative measures like don't build a library next to a volcano or leave your army on a Tsunami prone peninsula or just build that dang dam  to mitigate the flood waters, but apparently no matter how advanced we become as a race humans will always be plagued by the random and impending doom of the almighty tornado. Overall, I love the additions and whenever I need transport several hours into the future Civ VI is always my go to. Whether it be when I'm stuck at the airport waiting for a delayed flight, proving dominance against my friends across the country all weekend or sometimes even on a week night when I want to realise it's 6am I jumped through the night with no sleep and have an hour to hat myself at work for a day.

        <em>A generation ago</em>, the astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_sagan">Carl Sagan</a> stood here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure the exploration of the universe revealed by science. It's time to get going again. We're about to begin a journey that will take us from the infinitesimal to the infinite, from the dawn of time to the distant future. We'll explore galaxies and suns and worlds, surf the gravity waves of space-time, encounter beings that live in fire and ice, explore the planets of stars that never die, discover atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms.
      </p>
      <img class="size-4" src="img/test_cosmos.jpeg" alt="the Cosmos">
      <h3>COSMOS IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT US</h3>
      <p>It's the saga of how wandering bands of hunters and gatherers found their way to the stars, one adventure with many heroes. To make this journey, we'll need imagination. But imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine. This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules test ideas by experiment and observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail, follow the evidence wherever it leads and question everything. <strong>Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.</strong>

        <em>Duke and Kentucky</em>, famously stockpile <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2018/3/27/17165100/mcdonalds-all-americans-game-2018-duke-zion-williamson-rj-barrett-cameron-reddish-bol-bol">McDonald’s All-Americans</a> for their glorious — if brief — college layover, something seems amiss.

      <h3>It ain’t working. Not in late March, anyway.</h3>
      <p>You may have noticed Duke and Kentucky are not at the Final Four. Neither has made it since 2015. But consider the lineups that will be in Minneapolis this weekend. Twenty starters for Auburn, Michigan State, Texas Tech and Virginia – 14 juniors and seniors, two freshmen. Two. Michigan State’s Aaron Henry and Virginia’s Kihei Clark.
        “Everybody would like to have what Duke and Kentucky have as personnel,” Michigan State’s Tom Izzo was saying. “Both of them have had incredible years, but experience does matter, too, you know.”
